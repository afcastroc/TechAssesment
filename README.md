# TechAssesment

Greetings. My name is Andrés Castro and in this repository you will find the answer information to the technical test for the position of support engineer. The operational solutions were worked using Unity in its version 2020.3.19f1.

Folder structure

The repository folders are distributed as follows.
Where Answer to the questions contains the answers for part two of the test in a document in Word format.

In the folder "DLL_C ++ _ project" you will find the files necessary for the construction of the native C ++ DLL for point 2 of the first part of the test, the most important files are "ConcatentateHeader.h" as header file and "concatenateStrings .cpp ”where is the specific concatenation function. The DLL is called "Concatenate.dll."

On the other hand, the folder named "FirstPart_1" contains a Unity project with 4 of the 5 points of the first part of the test except point 4 which is developed in a different project, since for this specific point we worked using URP.

In the aforementioned folder, the mini-projects that contain the solution of each specific point will be organized in different folders.

In Unity, you will see the main folder structure and the resources of each solution will be organized in each folder (Scenes - Scripts - plugins, etc.) you just have to look for the scene inside the corresponding folder and give play to run the program and see the solution.

It is recommended to see the support videos where it is explained how each of the points of the first part of the test were approached, which are in the “Videos” folder.

Returning to the explanation, in the folder called “FirstPart_2” you will find the second Unity project with the point of VFX - Bezier. Within the project you will find two folders, in the so-called "VFX Spline" you will find the resources used to solve the planned problem.

Finally, remember to access the explanatory videos of each of the points of the first part of the test. Excuses for the level of English, hoping it is enough to understand how each of the points were addressed.

I appreciate the opportunity to develop the test, I know that the answers may not be the most optimal or the best way to represent the solutions, but I would very much like to have the opportunity to learn and be a better professional. I am convinced that Unity is the best place to grow as a person and as a game dev.
